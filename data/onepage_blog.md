# One page blog

At the end I have changed my blog again, but this time i have decided to design and coding my blog personally.

I thought, what are the requirements that i wish to have? 

Below there is my short list:

1.  It must be easy to write a new post.
2.  It must easy to update.
3.  It must not have a database.
4.  It must possible bring it to any hosting solution.

So, after some time, I had a solution to how write my blog.

To respond to first answer, I thought that a good solution could be to write the articles using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
It's super easy because it has few syntax elements to remember but they are enough to write any good article.

The second requirement has been easy to resolve because I decide to use [GIT](http://git-scm.com) (using classic *PUSH* command to Github repository).

No database, it could be hard to answer.
So, I decide to reduce the number of data for saving it into a simple json files.
This solution is good if i can load it from simple get rest request.
