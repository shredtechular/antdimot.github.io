# About me

My name is [Antonio Di Motta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimotta) and I’m an information technology enthusiast.

My principal passion is programming and it started many years ago when my father bought me my first computer: [The ZX Spectrum 48k](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum).
With it I began to program but also I played games for many hours (Match Day II and [Manic Miner](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner)).

I graduated in IT Industrial Expert at [ITIS B.Focaccia](http://www.itisfocaccia.it/) in [Salerno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salerno) and then I achieved a bachelor degree in Information Science at [Univerisità degli Studi di Salerno](http://www.unisa.it/).

My love for programming a had got a boost when I learnt C language knowledge using my [Commodore Amiga 1000](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1000) and later I studied others languages at university like Pascal, Lisp, Prolog, C and Java for several projects.
Java was my first step to Object Oriented programming paradigm. I love modelling things and behaviors with this paradigm.

My first work experience was as programmer of a CNC machine. One year later I arrived in SIS (Siemens It Solutions and Services) where I had several roles like programmer, team leader, project leader and solution architect.
Now I’m working as project engineer for Mate Consulting srl, a company located in Salerno, It specializes in design and implementation of complex software for big companies like Ansaldo.

I will always remember when Microsoft released .Net Framework and C# language, I loved it and still do today. For me C# is the best language that a developer can use to implement the projects.
Another key moment of my professional life was when I bought my iPhone and discovering a new class of software programming.

The commitment to do a work like mine requires continuously activities for learning, reading many good books (my favorite is [“Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture”](http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) of Martin Fowler) and comparing myself with others IT professionals (collegues and communities).
Forever.

I like sharing my knowledge with people and I hope that the others do the same with me.
I think that the true value of information technology is when it can help in the real world.
I think that the best ideas are simple and make a difference.
