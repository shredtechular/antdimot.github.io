One page blog
=============

It's my personal blog but you are free to download and/or fork the code.

It's very easy customizing it because the articles and config files are located into data folder.

The articles are made using Markdown syntax while the configuration using json.
 
There are two json files: config.json and articles.json.

The first allows for customizing information about the blog.

The second is an index of the articles that the blog will show.
