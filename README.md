One page blog
=============

It's my personal blog, but you are free to download and/or fork the project.

It's very easy customization it because the articles and config files are located into data folder.

The articles are made using Markdown syntax while the configuration using json.
 
There are two json files: [config.json](https://github.com/antdimot/antdimot.github.io/blob/master/data/config.json)
and [articles.json](https://github.com/antdimot/antdimot.github.io/blob/master/data/articles.json).

The first one allows for customization of the blog information.

The second is simple index of the articles that the blog will show.
